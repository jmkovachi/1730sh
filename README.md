## Reflection

This project was the second hardest assignment that we have had to do in this 
class (right behind ncurses). It was a very immerse project that required 
extensive knowledge of concepts like piping, IO redirection, job control, etc.
It is very satisying to have created a shell that actually functions like the
one that we have been programming on since the beginning of 1302.
